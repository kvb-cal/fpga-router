FPGA based robust router architecture
FPGA-powered Router: Building the Backbone of Tomorrow's Networks
This project sets out to create a robust and high-performance router architecture using the unparalleled flexibility and speed of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We aim to push the boundaries of network technology by crafting a router that is:

Adaptable: Capable of handling diverse network topologies and traffic patterns with intelligent routing algorithms.
Resilient: Equipped with error correction and protection mechanisms to ensure reliable data delivery even in challenging environments.
High-performing: Boasting low latency and high throughput to handle demanding data workloads seamlessly.
Efficient: Optimized for resource utilization and power consumption, catering to real-world deployment concerns.
